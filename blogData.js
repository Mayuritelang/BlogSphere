         "content": "Meta announced today it’s rolling out its first generative AI features for advertisers, allowing them to use AI to create backgrounds, expand images and generate multiple versions of ad text based on their original copy. The launch of the new tools follows the company’s Meta Connect event last week where the social media giant debuted its Quest 3 mixed-reality headset and a host of other generative AI products, including stickers and editing tools, as well as AI-powered smart glasses. In the case of AI tools for the ad industry, the new products may not be as wild as the celebrity AIs that let you chat with virtual versions of people like MrBeast or Paris Hilton, but they showcase how Meta believes generative AI can assist the brands and businesses that are responsible for delivering the majority of Meta’s revenue. The first among the trio of new features allows an advertiser to customize their creative assets by generating multiple different backgrounds to change the look of their product images. This is similar to the technology that Meta used to create the consumer-facing tool Backdrop, which allows users to change the scene or the background of their image by using prompts. However, in the ad toolkit, the backgrounds are generated for the advertiser based on their original product images and will tend to be “simple backgrounds with colors and patterns,” Meta explains. The feature is available to those advertisers using the company’s Advantage+ catalog to create their sales ads. Another feature, image expansion, allows advertisers to adjust their assets to fit different aspect ratios required across various products, like Feed or Reels, for example. Also available to Advantage+ creative in Meta’s Mads Manager, the AI feature would allow advertisers to spend less time repurposing their creative assets, including images and video, for different surfaces, Meta claims. Meta says it’s already tested these AI features with a small but diverse set of advertisers earlier this year, and their early results indicate that generative AI will save them five or more hours per week, or a total of one month per year. However, the company admits that there’s still work ahead to better customize the generative AI output to match each advertiser’s style. ",

        "content": "In November 2019, Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Angela Strange famously declared that, “Every company will be a fintech company.” Specifically, Strange projected that — in the not-too-distant-future — “nearly every company” would derive a significant portion of its revenue from financial services. Over the years, that prediction has played out to a certain extent. More companies have embedded fintech, specifically payments, into their offerings. It’s no wonder then that infrastructure companies have proven so resilient even in the venture slowdown. But not everyone agrees with Strange’s prediction. Joshua Silver, CEO and founder of Atlanta-based Rainforest, told TechCrunch in an interview that he believes that every software platform wants to embed financial services and embed payments into their offerings. “But they don’t want to be a fintech themselves,” he said. “Being a fintech means you are highly regulated. You have risk management to contend with. You have compliance burdens. And the vast majority of software companies just want to add payments.”",

        "content": "It’s no secret that alternative protein companies and others leveraging fermentation technology have an issue scaling to commercial production. Founders say that this is perhaps the number one challenge to taking their products from expensive to cost parity with traditional meat. Meet Pow.bio, a company founded by Ouwei Wang and Shannon Hall (no relation to the author) in 2019, that aims to help synthetic biology companies manufacture their products at cost parity amid a market of biomade products estimated to reach $4 trillion by 2040. Biology is the technology of today, Hall told TechCrunch. “We see that in lots of consumer-facing goods, and lots of biomedicines and in Impossible Foods products. More importantly, it’s behind our aspirations for how we’re going to deal with some of the biggest challenges in the world. For example, climate change impacts, population growth impacts and our aspirations to live and travel in space. All of that is predicated on having biology technology working. While companies like No Meat Factory, Planetary and Prolific Machines raised capital to build production facilities, Hall said the solution to the scaling problem won’t come from building large-scale bioreactors, even if the funding comes from the government. The real true story here is that most of the biology design stuff just is too damn expensive to take to the market, Hall added. Building bigger bioreactors doesn’t make that better, and as a result, what you see made are things you either need very tiny amounts of, like the heme protein in the Impossible Burger, or things that are crazy expensive, like lactoferrin, or human collagen, which is also nice to have alternatives.",

        "content": "Clearco announced several recapitalization efforts Wednesday, including a $60 million Series D round and new asset-backed financing. The facility provides up to $100 million in financing capacity and will support $850 million of Clearco originations over the next two years. Toronto-based Clearco uses AI and proprietary machine learning-based technology to underwrite businesses and help customers fund inventory and marketing invoices of between $10,000 and $2 million. To date, the company has financed over 10,000 companies with more than $2.5 billion. The company was founded as Clearbanc in 2015, and provided capital to e-commerce founders growing their businesses without equity dilution, hidden fees or compounding cost of capital. The recapitalization marks a turnaround for a company that’s had its share of ups and downs over the past year. However, after the original story went out this morning, I was tipped that some layoffs occurred Wednesday, suggesting the company’s “downs” are not over yet: The company confirmed via email that it was not a mass reduction in labor, but that it did let go of six employees in what it called, “a single-digit restructuring for redundant roles.” The company also said “we are moving into growth mode and have an open headcount of approximately 10 roles. This was a very small restructuring as we recalibrated the business after the transactions closed.",

        "content": "What if you could interact with any piece of software using natural language? Imagine typing in a prompt and having AI translate the instructions into machine-comprehensible commands, executing tasks on a PC or phone to accomplish the goal that you just described? That’s the idea behind Rabbit, a rebranding of Cyber Manufacture Co., which is building a custom, AI-powered UI layer designed to sit between a user and any operating system. Founded by Jesse Lyu, who holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the University of Liverpool, and Alexander Liao, previously a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Rabbit is creating a platform, Rabbit OS, underpinned by an AI model that can — so Lyu and Liao claim — see and act on desktop and mobile interfaces the same ways that humans can. “The advancements in generative AI have ignited a wide range of initiatives within the technology industry to define and establish the next level of human-machine interaction,” Lyu told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Our perspective is that the ultimate determinant of success lies in delivering an exceptional end-user experience. Drawing upon our past endeavors and experiences, we’ve realized that revolutionizing the user experience necessitates a bespoke and dedicated platform and device. This fundamental principle underpins the current product and technical stack chosen by Rabbit.” Rabbit — which has $20 million in funding contributed by Khosla Ventures, Synergis Capital and Kakao Investment, which a source familiar with the matter says values the startup at between $100 million and $150 million — isn’t the first to attempt layering a natural language interface on top of existing software. Google’s AI research lab, DeepMind, has explored several approaches for teaching AI to control computers, for example having an AI observe keyboard and mouse commands from people completing “instruction-following” tasks such as booking a flight. Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University recently open sourced a web-navigating AI agent that they claim can figure out how to do things like use a search engine and order items online. Elsewhere, there are apps like the viral Auto-GPT, which tap AI startup OpenAI’s text-generating models to act “autonomously,” interacting with apps, software and services both online and local, like web browsers and word processors.",

        "content": "One thing is clear this year: Generative AI is having a tremendous impact on the software industry, and a week doesn’t pass without software companies announcing their plans to incorporate the seemingly game-changing technology into their platforms. This week, it’s Okta’s turn. The identity company is making a slew of AI-related announcements at the company’s Oktane customer conference, taking place this week in San Francisco. “I think AI is the next big wave in technology. I think it’s as important and big and impactful as the internet, as cloud, as mobile,” Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told TechCrunch. For Okta, that means training a model on all of the data it’s been collecting about identity and putting that to work to help make customers safer. “We have a new set of capabilities we’re launching called Okta AI,” he said. “It’s taking all of the really, really valuable data we have from risk signals and usage patterns and customers and policies, and combining them with the latest and greatest AI technology.” As McKinnon points out, Okta AI isn’t a product per se, so much as a set of capabilities that will be added over time across the platform, some of which will incorporate predictive AI to help security teams understand possible threats, and some of which will allow users to interact with the data to pinpoint problems more easily using generative AI. While this will involve many different pieces, he highlighted three in particular. The first, Identity Threat Protection, looks at traditional identity protection, checking for things like the computer, network, location and other clues to ensure the person signing in is who they say they are — but it doesn’t stop there. “With Identity Threat Protection with Okta, AI, the evaluation of your security posture doesn’t stop. It’s continuously getting signals from the entire ecosystem — from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks or Zscalar or anyone else — and this is integrated with identity fraud protection. The second that there’s any kind of risk anywhere, whether it’s malware on the device or a bad network security posture, [it can identify it],” McKinnon said.",

        "content": "Physical security keys remain one of the best ways to secure user accounts, but the fact that new users have to register them before they can use them often adds quite a bit of friction. Yubico, the company behind the ubiquitous FIDO-certified YubiKeys, is now making this significantly easier by giving its enterprise users the ability to send pre-registered keys to employees. When they receive their new keys, all they have to do is navigate to their company’s web application or identity providers’ login page, enter a PIN provided by their IT department and that’s that. The new FIDO Pre-reg service is now in a limited access period, specifically for Okta customers in the U.S. (the company is making the announcement at Oktane, Okta’s user conference). As of now, interested users must purchase keys through Yubico’s YubiEnterprise Subscription program and use Okta Identity Engine (OIE), Okta Adaptive MFA (AMFA) and Okta Workflows. For now, the program will include the YubiKey5 NFC and YubiKey 5C NFC keys. At general availability, the program will support all of the company’s keys. “Organizations have historically been challenged to accelerate user adoption of phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO passkey solutions like YubiKeys at speed and scale,” said Jeff Wallace, senior vice president, Product, at Yubico. “Typically, administrators manually register YubiKeys on behalf of each employee before delivering to them in-office or shipping the key to the employee’s location. FIDO Pre-reg eliminates these challenges and provides a quick and easy way to adopt phishing resistance throughout a company on day one with turnkey YubiKey activation — all while reducing IT costs.” In an interview last month, Yubico co-founder Stina Ehrensvärd told me that the company is now building more than a million YubiKeys per month. Only a few years ago, it was producing about 200,000 per month. In part, the company has been able to increase production, which is mostly happening in Yubico’s home country of Sweden, because it has invested heavily in automation. “For many years at Yubico, we did not have enough stock,” she told me. “We’d run out of keys on our web store and people had to wait. That problem is behind us for now — until we get more orders — but at this time, we have plenty in stock and it’s very reassuring to know that we can actually make big volumes, good quality, high security, and with good margins.”",

Founder and CEO Ben Leventhal says that the proceeds, which bring Blackbird’s total raised to $35 million, will be put toward helping Blackbird scale its operations. “The restaurant business model is broken,” Leventhal told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It can be really expensive to remain at the top of a sea of competition. Operational costs are also at an all-time high, and restaurants need revenue. There’s only two paths forward: creating new revenue streams or creating regulars who’ll want to come back.” To Leventhal’s point, a 2022 survey from the National Restaurant Association (NRA) found that 54% of restaurant owners had to reduce the size of their dishes in response to rising food costs. A further 47% of the respondents said that they had to increase menu prices, as well. And restaurant failure rates aren’t exactly declining. Restaurants have about a 20% success rate, according to the NRA, with about 60% failing within the first year and 80% failing within five years of opening. Leventhal is perhaps best known for co-founding Eater, the food and drink publication (acquired by Vox in 2013), and Resy, the restaurant reservation service (acquired by American Express — which is also a Blackbird investor — in 2019). He came up with the idea for Blackbird in the early days of the pandemic after noticing that restaurants were finding innovative ways, like rolling out clothing lines and selling pancake mix, to keep customers engaged. “I was struck by the ingenuity of restaurants, who used their brands and audience to create sales streams that weren’t food,” Leventhal said. “This led me to start thinking about other ways restaurants could combat the serious business challenges of declining margins and eroding direct customer relationships. ”",

Jon Bratseth, previously a VP architect in the big data and AI group at Yahoo and one of the main contributors to Vespa, has been appointed CEO. Yahoo says it’ll continue to invest in Vespa (with cash) and remain its largest customer following the spinout. Yahoo will also own a stake in Vespa and hold a seat on the spun-out firm’s board of directors. Yahoo created Vespa back in 2005 after acquiring paid search service provider Overture, and, through it, a Norwegian search engine called AlltheWeb.com. Working with the e-commerce division within Yahoo, the AllTheWeb team of roughly 30 people retooled their search tech into a more general-purpose tool that Yahoo developers could use internally to compute over large-scale datasets in real time. Over the next decade or so, Yahoo expanded Vespa along several directions, enabling the tool to handle input beyond text strings, personalize content based on users’ click-through histories and take direction from machine learning algorithms. Then, in 2017, Yahoo open sourced Vespa, hoping to rally developer support behind the software — and foster something of an ecosystem both internally and externally. It was arguably Yahoo’s biggest open source software release since Hadoop in 2006, involving a substantial rewrite of the Vespa codebase by the Vespa group, still based in Norway. And it evidently paid off. Today, Vespa drives searches and related-article recommendations on Yahoo-owned sites and performs ad targeting on Yahoo-branded web properties such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo’s advertising network. Yahoo claims that it’s using around 150 apps created with Vespa and that these apps collectively serve a user base of a billion people — processing 800,000 queries per second.",

The company said that Uno’s team will help speed up the public launch of the Okta Personal tier, a password manager for consumers. Uno, founded by former Google engineer Parteek Saran, launched an app earlier this year to make password management easier for users through a design-centric approach. The company raised $3 million in funding from backers including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Lookout founder Kevin Mahaffey and Dug Song from Duo Security. The app’s main draw was to handle one-click login on the web by remembering your credentials for the site and even letting you quickly access a one-time code through the extension. Saran’s idea was to make security simple for users so they don’t have to worry a lot about password management. Okta mentioned that Uno will be discontinued as an app and the team will join the company to work on Okta Personal. The company didn’t give any content about the deal size. “The Uno team has deep experience building consumer-first, design-focused and easy-to-use password management and personal identity technologies. The addition of Uno’s talent and expertise in security, identity and AI allows us to accelerate the rollout of Okta Personal,” Vivek Raman, VP of Engineering at Okta, said in a statement. The enterprise identity management company said that it has been testing Okta Personal in beta since last year. The company noted that consumers based in the U.S. and Canada can sign up and start using it. Okta said it plans to expand the app’s availability to other countries soon. Okta Personal currently has a web app and an iOS app for password management. The app will also have features such as easy credential sharing and autofill. The app’s website suggests that the company is working on rolling out family sharing soon. The company didn’t specify if some of Uno’s features such as the easy reading of one-time passwords from email will be integrated into Okta Personal.

       "content": "CoPilot, a digital training app that matches users with one-on-one remote fitness coaches, has raised $6.5 million in Series A-1 funding led by Jackson Square Ventures. The app, which has seen more than 1.5 million workouts completed on the platform, matches users with a coach they connect with in order to receive a custom fitness plan. The idea behind the company is to give users access to a personal coach for the fraction of the price of an in-person fitness trainer.The Pittsburgh-based startup was founded in 2019 by CEO Matt Spettel and CTO Gabriel Madonna. Spettel told TechCrunch in an interview that his personal journey with fitness is woven into the birth of CoPilot. He says he got into fitness when he was in high school after his best friend and now co-founder Madonna encouraged him to start working out. Spettel says he fell in love with taking care of his body as he underwent his personal fitness journey. The pair then starting tinkering with ideas in the fitness space while Spettel was studying at Carnegie Mellon and Madonna was at MIT. The duo’s first few ideas were quite different from where they are now, as they initially started building wearables and hardware devices designed to help gym enthusiasts optimize their workouts. “We built that product and threw it out into the world and saw what people had to say, and we had this realization,” Spettel said. “The problem to solve in fitness is not about optimizing an enthusiast’s workout, it’s helping the average person just know generally what to do and more importantly, helping them actually show up and do it. We became really focused on that problem, which led us to what CoPilot is today.” Since then the duo have been focused on building a product that gives people unlimited access to their own personal fitness coach. Spettel says that although access to an in-person personal trainer is great, it’s expensive and requires people to go to an actual gym, which is why CoPilot wants to make personal trainers more accessible. CoPilot’s target demographic are people who have a simple baseline of activity and are aware that exercise is important but have struggled to be consistent and hit their goals. CoPilot is available on both Android and iOS, and the service costs $99 per month. .",

        "content": "Mainstream social media platforms could face limits on their ability to take down independent journalism that violates their terms and conditions under a proposal agreed by European Union lawmakers yesterday. In a vote Tuesday, the European parliament set its negotiating position for upcoming talks with the Council on the bloc’s draft Media Freedom Act — taking aim at what MEPs called “arbitrary decisions by big platforms.” The text adopted by MEPs expands on the European Commission’s original proposal by setting out a requirement for larger platforms (i.e., very large online platforms, or VLOPs, with more than 45 million regional active monthly users) to give media services providers a heads-up of a planned takedown of their content — giving them 24 hours to reply to the objections before any restriction or suspension is imposed. The original Commission text merely urges these platforms to consider freedom and pluralism of media, act diligently and be transparent when they exercise editorial responsibility — that is, by taking down journalism they deem incompatible with their terms and conditions — and then, after the fact, provide an explanation of their actions to media service providers “as early as possible.” In the upcoming trilogue talks involving the Commission, the bloc’s co-legislators, the parliament, and the Council will need to negotiate to find a compromise on a final text so the shape of the law is not fixed in stone yet. And it remains to be seen whether the parliamentarians’ push for the Act to go further in safeguarding media from arbitrary decisions by larger platforms stands or falls. The parliament vote was a fairly substantial one in favor of the amended file — with 448 votes in favor versus 102 against (and 75 abstentions).",

        "content" : "The move toward open banking payments, especially in the EU, effectively kicked-off the fintech boom. Open banking standards meant that fintech startups could create wallets and effectively become banks, or at least “neo banks,” in practical day-to-day terms. Digital wallets are now the leading payment method globally in e-commerce, with a 49% share, according to the Global Payments Report by Worldpay. That said, so-called account-to-account (A2A) payments are on a streak, with the global A2A transaction value surpassing $525 billion in 2022, due to real-time payment rails now being available. There’s been a growing number of startups now taking advantage of this A2A boom, among them Trustly out of Stockholm, which to date has raised €23 million. However, they may now feel some heat from their other Stockholm-based neighbor, Brite Payments, which today announced a Series A fund-raise of $60 million led by specialist B2B software investor Dawn Capital. Also joining the round was global VC Headline (the re-branded e.ventures) out of their European practice Headline, and existing investor Incore (out of Sweden). Headline is made up of multiple seed and growth funds (in Europe, the U.S., Asia and Brazil) and in Europe it’s spread across Berlin, Paris and London. Prior to this round, Brite had raised seed cash from a smaller non-institutional investor Agof Investments, which is run by Marcus Blom alongside Nicolai Chamizo (Brite chairman and also Incore CEO). Brite, which only launched in 2019 and was founded by former Klarna exec Lena Hackelöer, had something of a breakout year in 2022, claiming to have doubled its transaction volume and revenue, and reached profitability. Its platform is now available in 25 countries across Europe, though not the U.K. (which is no longer an EU member).It’s worth noting that Dawn Capital was an early backer of other Swedish fintech leaders such as iZettle (sold to PayPal for $2.2 billion) and Tink (acquired by Visa for $2.0 billion). Headline has previously backed Pismo, the Brazilian payments infrastructure provider (which exited to Visa for $1.0 billion).",

       "content": "Krafton India has launched a gaming incubator in the South Asian nation as it seeks to expand the local ecosystem and support the domestic talent looking to enter the fast-growing gaming market. Called Krafton India Gaming Incubator (KIGI), the program aims to support six to 10 teams annually, with the total duration ranging from six months to a year. Selected participants will get guidance, mentorship, access to Krafton’s resources and financial support, typically between $50,000 and $150,000, depending on their needs, the company said on Wednesday. Krafton India, which recently relaunched the popular mobile title BGMI, said it would look for early-stage Indian startups and those at the conception stage, as well as student teams and independent developers for the KIGI program. The selected participants will be mentored by various gaming industry executives, game developers and industry experts from South Korea and India. Krafton will also offer the participants access to its internal resources, including data and market research, to help them build their respective products for the Indian markets worldwide. “Given the huge demand for gaming content [in India], the supply side has yet to mature. There are many great startups and small- to medium-sized and large-size game developers, but I think in the ecosystem, there is a lack of diversity,” said Sean Hyunil Sohn, CEO of Krafton India, in an interview. The South Korean company has appointed former Gameloft and Electronic Arts producer Anuj Sahani as the head of its incubator program. Sahani told TechCrunch that he, along with other executives at Krafton, will look for relevant participants by going through their applications and will pick the ones that fit the company’s global standards. To be sure, Sony and Epic Games also have incubation programs in various markets to support indie developers and early-stage startups. But those are limited to a specific gaming engine or platform, Sohn said, adding that Krafton’s program is game engine and platform agnostic, meaning the incubating teams can develop games using technologies based on their requirements and for platforms — not restricted to mobile that is dominating the gaming market in India — including PC and consoles.",

        "content": "Investors have historically been skeptical of green hydrogen. High production costs, expensive infrastructure builds, competition with batteries and minimal government support have made the green hydrogen sector a risky bet. But at least one company, Electric Hydrogen, seems to have found a way to convince investors that its tech is a bet they should take. Electric Hydrogen (EH2), a Massachusetts-based green hydrogen technology company, has just become green hydrogen’s first unicorn, with a $380 million Series C raise that brought its valuation up to $1 billion. That round also brought EH2’s total funding to roughly $600 million, per Crunchbase data. The startup is backed by heavy hitters like Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, United Airlines, BP and Fortescue Metals. The funds will be used to expand production capacity of its electrolyzers, according to a spokesperson for the company. Electrolyzers are devices that use a process called electrolysis to split water (H2O) into its constituent elements, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). They are expensive and consume tons of renewable energy to make a small amount of hydrogen. EH2 says it has figured out a way to produce more hydrogen at a cheaper price. Part of that apparent success is the company’s technology. EH2’s engineers designed and built all critical electrolyzer components in-house in the company’s Massachusetts lab. They increased performance to decrease costs, a move that came from Raffi Garabedian, EH2’s CEO and former chief technology officer at First Solar. Garabedian’s co-founder, Dave Eaglesham, was also a previous First Solar CTO. EH2 is also striking while the iron is hot. The startup is able to leverage its performance gains to get the most out of the incentives on offer with the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. EH2 says those offers will help to make green hydrogen that is actually competitive in today’s market and doesn’t use cheap natural gas to generate greenhouse-gas emissions. In parts of the country where renewables are cheap and tax credits outpace production costs, hydrogen could even be free to buyers. Much of the transportation world is embracing the battery-fueled revolution. But for big vehicles like trucks and planes, as well as industrial sites like steel mills, fertilizer factories and chemical plants, batteries aren’t the right fit. Green hydrogen is increasingly being seen as the solution to moving green power over long distances.",

Video captured by Cruise and viewed by TechCrunch shows a robotaxi braking and then running over a pedestrian who is laying in the street after being struck by a human-driven car and launched in front of the autonomous vehicle. Cruise said the driver of the vehicle who initially hit the pedestrian fled the scene.  Cruise said in its account of the events that the robotaxi “braked aggressively” to minimize impact. Still, the pedestrian was run over and then stuck under the vehicle, according to police as well as video from local bystanders that show the person under the robotaxi. TechCrunch viewed the video, which shows a Cruise vehicle stopped at a traffic light and then proceeding once it turned green. The cameras, which include a forward-facing, rear-facing and side-facing cameras, captures a human-driven vehicle in the left lane accelerating through the intersection. Moments later, the video shows a person, who has entered the street on the far left side, being hit by the human-driven car, then flying over the front hood, up onto the roof of the vehicle and down the right side before falling into the street. The pedestrian landed in the lane to the right of the human-driven vehicle, which is where the Cruise robotaxi was. Police are still investigating the matter. A San Francisco Police Department spokesperson released a statement: On 10/02/23 at approximately 9:31 pm officers responded to 5th and Market Streets regarding a vehicle collision involving a pedestrian. Officers arrived on scene and discovered an autonomous vehicle struck an adult pedestrian. Officers rendered aid and summoned medics to the scene and transported the pedestrian to the hospital.

        "content": "Spotify today unveiled what’s next for the future of its audiobooks service. At an event hosted in its New York offices on Tuesday afternoon, the company announced a new business model where it will now provide Spotify Premium subscribers with access to a subset of its audiobooks catalog — a total of 150,000 titles — without an additional charge. The service will initially launch in the U.K. and Australia starting today and will launch in the U.S. later this year, with more markets to follow. “Audiobooks today have one big dominating player. And just like in music and podcasting, we believe that many more consumers want to consume audiobooks and want to listen to audiobooks,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, speaking at the event. “And just like in music and podcasting, we’re really excited to be able to bring all the amazing tools that we built for creators and consumers alike to enable more discovery of these amazing audiobooks to the entire world,” he added. Powered by its acquisition of the digital audiobook distributor Findaway, Spotify first launched audiobooks in the U.S. in September 2022, with a catalog of 300,000 titles to start before expanding to other English-speaking markets later in the year and Canada in early 2023. At the service’s debut last year, Spotify touted the company’s potential to tap into a growing market, noting that audiobooks were just a 6% to 7% share of the wider book market, but the category was growing by 20% year-over-year. However, using Spotify’s service has not been as seamless as it could be for consumers because the company attempted to work around the app stores’ rules regarding in-app purchases by requiring users to buy audiobooks from the Spotify website in order to play them in its app. Plus, Spotify couldn’t direct customers to the website because of the app stores’ “anti-steering” rules, which prevent app developers from pointing to alternative means of paying outside of the app stores’ own payment mechanisms. With access to audiobooks as part of the Premium service, listening to the books will become easier for end users.",

In the ad, the massively influential creator appeared to be offering 10,000 viewers an iPhone 15 Pro for just $2. In most cases, this would be a clear indication of a scam, but coming from MrBeast, it could actually be believable. MrBeast (a 25-year-old named Jimmy Donaldson with more subscribers than any other individual on YouTube) got famous by creating increasingly absurd stunt videos in which he gives people free homes and cars with no strings attached (so long as they agree to be in his video). Or, more recently, he’ll ask people from “every country on Earth” to compete for a $250,000 prize in a series of Olympic-like mini games. So, if you’re not particularly privy to spotting scams, and you’re scrolling TikTok late at night when you’re not thinking straight, it could be within the realm of possibility that MrBeast would buy 10,000 iPhones to give away via TikTok ad. After all, he literally has given away free iPhones to unsuspecting trick or treaters. Deceptive deepfakes aren’t new, but as AI becomes especially trendy among investors and consumers alike, the technology is becoming easier than ever to access. While internet famous celebrities like MrBeast appeal to younger generations, older consumers are being fooled too. This week alone, actor Tom Hanks and CBS anchor Gayle King both warned their followers that they’re being deepfaked into fraudulent ads.",

There’s a 178-degree viewing angle for generous off-axis viewing, and it has 8,192 levels of pressure detection. The display is mostly reflection-free thanks to its etched glass matte surface, which also helps it feel a lot like drawing on traditional paper media. As mentioned, Xencelabs also includes two dfferent pens right in the box, including one with three buttons and a thicker grip, as well as a thin pen that’s lighter in the hand; both pens include erasers and there are a range of nibs in the box, including both standard and those designed to mimic felt nibs. Another included accessory is Xencelabs’ Quick Keys controller, which has a built-in two-tone OLED display. This features a number of customizable buttons that control common functions in drawing, painting and photo-editing apps, like undo/redo, zoom/pan and much more. These can be set on a per-app basis or tailored to your needs, and the OLED readout offers a lot of added convenience versus Wacom’s ExpressKeys, which has no integrated display. Xencelabs also bundles the display with a tilting stand that gives you plenty of options for using it both mostly upright as a traditional screen, or at a range of different angles comfortable for drawing on a desktop surface. Wacom, by contrast, only includes two integrated kickstand feet with the Cintiq Pro 24, which gives you just one slightly inclined angle for drawing without purchasing additional stand or arm-mounting options. The bezels on the tablet are generous enough to make you feel like you’ve got room to maneuver without blocking what you’re working on, but they still put the screen in focus. The screen is also flush with the bezels, and all of the above are covered with that etched glass for a smooth, continuous modern look.",

       "content": "U.S. lawmakers have written a letter to TikTok questioning its independence from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, in the wake of a recent report from The Wall St. Journal that noted that several high-level executives had been transferred from ByteDance to TikTok, where they took on top roles across the organization. The report noted the former ByteDance execs now held key positions in advertising, HR, monetization, business marketing and others related to TikTok’s e-commerce initiatives. The letter, penned by senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), asks TikTok to explain why it has hired several executives from ByteDance, “further calling into question the independence of TikTok’s operations and the security of its U.S. users’ information,” they wrote. The WSJ’s report on the transfers suggested that the employee movement between the two organizations indicates that TikTok still maintains close ties to its Beijing-based parent, despite the video social network’s attempt to distance itself from its Chinese roots — and the applicable laws that could apply if the Chinese government were to pressure TikTok for its data or use the app in the spread of CCP propaganda. TikTok, however, has consistently maintained its independence from China, even moving U.S. user data to Oracle servers in the U.S., in hopes of staving off a U.S.-wide TikTok ban. Still, concerns about TikTok’s ties to China have led to the app being banned across a number of U.S. government-issued devices, including those in use by the U.S. House of Representatives and various U.S. states. Montana also became the first U.S. state to ban TikTok on personal devices, while New York City this summer became the latest government to ban TikTok from city-owned devices this summer, following a state-wide ban in 2020. In the new letter, the senators noted that even TikTok employees had found the transfers “alarming” and reportedly joked that “TikTok is solving its ByteDance problem by moving ByteDance to the U.S.” It also stated that the relationship between the two entities “poses a unique risk to the security and privacy” of U.S. user data, and referenced earlier reports where TikTok had been found to be spying on U.S. journalists,",

        "content": "Sam Altman, Peak XV, and Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman’s AI grant are among backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that’s aiming to assist businesses in automating numerous workflows in previously unexplored ways. Induced AI, founded this year, enables businesses to input their workflows in plain English, subsequently converting the instructions into pseudo-code in real time for numerous repetitive tasks typically managed by back offices. The eponymous platform spins up Chromium-based browser instances, and uses its tech to read on-screen content and control the browser similarly to a human in order to complete various steps of a workflow. This allows the browser instances to interact with websites even if they don’t have an API, Aryan Sharma, Induced AI co-founder and chief executive, showed in a demo. Zapier is among the firms that pioneered the API integration economy, connecting disparate applications, offering businesses a route toward automated and efficient workflows. The platform’s use of automated workflows provided companies with a mechanism to streamline operations and innovate, all without necessitating an in-depth understanding of technical processes. Eighteen-year-old Sharma (at right in the lead picture), who co-founded the startup with 19-year-old Ayush Pathak (left), is betting that Induced AI can build an integration economy for the browser-native workflows. The workflows can be complex and logic-driven processes, including two-factor authentication dialogues. Induced AI applies a bi-directional interaction system, enabling human involvement in certain steps as needed, while autonomously managing the remainder, said Sharma. “We’ve purpose-built a browser environment on top of Chromium that’s designed for autonomous workflow runs. It has its own memory, file system, and authentication credentials (email, phone number) to do complex flows. As far as I know, we’re the first to take this approach of redesigning the browser for native AI agent use. So complex logins, 2FA (we auto fill in auth codes/SMSs), file downloads, storing and re-using data is possible that other autonomous agents can’t do,” said Sharma. The startup, which currently has just five members, has signed up a few small to mid-sized customers in recent weeks, including a sales firm that uses Induced AI for employee onboarding, and is working on many new use cases, said Sharma.",

The Browser Company is using a combination of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and Anthropic’s models to build lightweight but useful features. Just like other AI-powered assistants present in rival browsers, you can converse with ChatGPT or ask questions in the context of the current page. However, Arc has added some nifty features with its implementation. Arc Max can rename pinned tabs based on the page title and make them short and easy to read. Plus, it can also rename downloaded files based on the content in them. The new AI-powered feature also can fetch a summary preview of a link when you hover over it and press shift. There are tons of AI-powered tools on the web ranging from web apps to extensions. The trick is to make them useful by integrating them well within your workflow, so you don’t have to go out of the way to use an “AI-powered feature to boost your productivity.” In an interview with The Verge, The Browser Company said it made various prototypes to make AI features contextual. The team experimented with automatic notetaking by selecting the text and turning the forward button into an exploration page (StumbleUpon anyone?). Earlier this year, Arc unveiled a feature called Boosts, that lets you remove some elements from a page and customize it. In one of the prototypes, the company experimented with a way for users to create Boosts with prompts. But these features didn’t make the final list as they were not fast enough. In a livestreamed announcement, the company’s CEO Josh Miller said that these features are not set in stone. He said that the browser is going to keep these five features at least for 90 days and meanwhile gather feedback about them to decide which ones to keep.",

        "content": "Promova, the language learning app with more than 11 million users, today launched “Dyslexia Mode,” which uses a specialized typeface called Dysfont so people with dyslexia can learn a new language more easily. In addition, the new mode reduces color brightness and implements multi-sensory teaching techniques. Dysfont was developed by designer Martin Pysny, who was diagnosed with dyslexia at seven years old. The font tackles the main challenges of reading, such as letter switching, letter reversals and text instability (words that appear to shake, move or change in shape). For example, Dysfont makes it easier to differentiate between the most common letter reversals: p, q, b and d. It also alters uppercase and lowercase letters to make them look as similar as possible. “Unfortunately, people with dyslexia have always fallen behind in learning languages because the process is very exhausting for us,” Pysny said in a statement. “And, unfortunately, despite their popularity, language learning platforms are not designed for dyslexics… I’m grateful to Promova for becoming the first company in the world to implement this font. Together, we can help empower dyslexics to learn foreign languages successfully.” There are plenty of apps that address other learning challenges that people with dyslexia experience, such as spelling, phonics and sentence structure. However, Promova is the first language learning app to launch a specific mode for dyslexic learners. Last year, Google launched an app called Reading Mode to help people with visual imparities and dyslexia read content on Android devices. The company also recently rolled out a reading mode on Google Chrome and Classroom for students with dyslexia and ADHD. Promova’s new feature arrives just in time for National Dyslexia Awareness Month and is available for free on the platform. Users can enable Dyslexia Mode by going to their profile and tapping Settings. Promova launched in 2019 to give learners custom lesson plans and other tools like vocabulary/grammar courses, tutoring sessions, a community page to chat with other users and progress tracking. The app offers nine languages — English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Korean and Ukrainian. ",

So does the valuation cut mean that ByteDance is a struggling business? Not in the slightest. TechCrunch Desktop Logo ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, is back in the news. The company recently offered to buy back its stock from its employees, but the issue is, it’s valuing itself at around $223 billion, which is about 26% less than the $300 billion at which it previously offered to buy back its own equity. So does the valuation cut mean that ByteDance is a struggling business? Not in the slightest. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.On the contrary, ByteDance is an insanely good business. The company’s 2022 and Q1 2023 results point to a business that is quickly approaching annual revenue of $100 billion, and more interestingly, a profitability profile that’s similar to some of the U.S.’s most valuable tech giants. Just look at how the company has performed over the past few years: 2020: Revenue more than doubled, per Reuters, to $34.3 billion, with an operating loss of around $2 billion. 2021: Revenue rose 70% to around $58 billion, according to Reuters. In the same year, the company generated EBITDA of about $14 billion, per the FT. 2022: Revenue expanded around 38% in 2022 to just over $85 billion, according to the WSJ. Operating profit came to more than $20 billion, per the same source. The FT reported that its EBITDA came in at around $25 billion. It’s impressive to see a company scaling its revenue from $34 billion to more than $85 billion in the span of just two years, but it’s downright insane that ByteDance pulled that off while also going from an operating loss of $2 billion in 2020 to an operating profit of more than $20 billion. What’s more, the WSJ reported that ByteDance had an operating profit of nearly $6 billion in Q1 2023, nearly double its Q1 2022 result. Such results have cleanly catapulted ByteDance into the big leagues. For reference, Meta reported operating income of $7.23 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which means ByteDance is within spitting distance of its U.S. rival. ",

        "content": "“MySQL is still the world’s most popular database; still runs 70% of the internet. Oracle has been slow to respond to this changing and evolving world of AI and generally, modern MySQL is being carried forward by PlanetScale,” PlanetScale CEO and President Sam Lambert told me when I asked him why the company decided to go this route. “What we’ve seen through industry trends is that AI is not just leading to a ballooning of vector data but relational data itself. People have proprietary data, they have the inputs that are used for these models, and then you create this kind of circular feedback loop: you’re seeing what people are searching for, you’re inputting that into your relational database, then you’re training on it, you’re storing vectors and you’re doing similarity search. We couldn’t really let ourselves get bound to Oracle’s lack of pace on this.” Lambert noted that it only took his team about six weeks to complete the work on adding vector support. The team is now testing to ensure that its solution can scale before it will roll out to all PlanetScale users, but the company is also looking to see if it can contribute this code upstream into the MySQL open source edition. “We’ll make an attempt to upstream this to be good citizens,” Lambert, who came to PlanetScale in 2021 after being the VP of Engineering at GitHub, said. “We believe in open source. My background at GitHub gave me a long, long time of experience in the open source community, we love open source.” To a large degree, PlanetScale’s value proposition has always been that it can scale well beyond any of its competitors. Vitess, after all, came out of YouTube. The company now promises that it can bring this scalability to vector databases and search. Lambert argues that it makes sense to keep the vector features close to the database. In his view, storing vectors isn’t a very complicated way to store data, so it’s easy enough to add it to the existing database and keep the two systems close. This also now means that, ideally, WordPress and other tools that run on top of MySQL may soon get easy access to these features as well, which would allow the developers in those ecosystems to more easily add AI-based features that make use of custom data as well.

       "content": "A whopping 10% to 15% of the world’s energy goes toward something that, unless you’re a chemical engineer, you probably never think about: separating gasses. Most of that happens the old-fashioned way by boiling different gasses off the top of various liquids, many of them petrochemicals. As simple as that sounds, the equipment needed to do that is usually enormous. Chemical refineries, for example, can resemble sprawling cities, their distillation columns towering over a web of pipes. All that boiling requires a lot of heat, which tends to come from fossil fuels. There’s another way, though, called membrane gas separation. In it, a membrane works like a filter, allowing the desired gas or gasses through while leaving the others behind. With membranes, there’s no need for heat, just pressure, something an electrically powered compressor can provide. No fossil fuels required, and the potential for energy savings could be significant. Today, membrane gas separation represents a relatively small part of the market. But with calls to decarbonize heavy industry, that could change. Osmoses, a startup spun out of MIT and Stanford, is hoping to capitalize on that with a new type of membrane that the company says is more selective and less energy-intensive than others on the market today. Osmoses makes membranes that are so thin — just a few hundred nanometers — that they need to be plied with additional layers to give them structure. In that wispy-thin layer are holes that are mere angstroms wide, “about the same size as gas molecules,” said Holden Lai, co-founder and CTO of Osmoses. Osmoses is starting with the hydrogen market. “It’s really one of the molecules that is defining the energy transition in terms of alternative gas molecules that can replace current solutions,” Benedetti told TechCrunch+. “Hydrogen is the one that shows the highest potential.” Like many parts of the climate tech sector, it’s still too early to tell whether Osmoses will succeed in cracking a profitable portion of the hydrogen market open. Perhaps another market will be more lucrative, but with the IRA’s subsidies guaranteed through 2032, hydrogen will be hard to ignore.",

        "content": "The highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he’s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: “The odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.” The 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange’s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It’s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors. But how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here? Before FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm. Within two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding. The company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat’s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires’ polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O’Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to. Bankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied. With the trial beginning, we’re witnessing how FTX’s story ends. But what’s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?",

Qobra helps businesses manage sales compensation so that managers don’t have to use Excel spreadsheets for this pesky task. It starts by bringing data to Qobra. That’s why the startup has built integrations with many CRM, ERP and data warehouses, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Microsoft Dynamics, Google Big Query, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Zoho and Amazon Redshift. Operations and finance teams can then define compensation rules and targets based on historical data. The startup offers a no-code interface that works a bit like a spreadsheet. You can use variables, such as the churn rate or the monthly recurring revenue, and use that as a value in the calculation of sales compensation. Qobra supports the usual acceleration rules. For instance, if a sales person beats their quota (>100%) or ends the quarter below their quota, there can be different formulas. Qobra can also be used as a dashboard to analyze past performance on a team or individual contributor basis. Managers can grant access to other people’s performances so that sales people can compare their performance to others. Some of Qobra’s clients include Doctolib, CoachHub, SeLoger and PayFit. With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to the U.K. and the U.S. It competes with several companies operating in the same space, such as CaptivateIQ, QuotaPath and Palette in France.

But, according to Matveev, his life hasn’t changed much since he was outed as an alleged cybercriminal and put on the FBI’s most wanted list. “We are Russian people, we are not afraid of the American government,” Matveev told TechCrunch in an online interview. “My life has changed for the better after the sanctions, I don’t feel them on me, as well as sanctions are a plus for my security, so sanctions help us.” In an interview where he answered both in English and in Russian, Matveev said that being sanctioned means Russia will not deport him. And to avoid getting caught outside of Russia, he won’t travel anymore, and said he has “burned” his passport. His last trip, he said, was to Thailand in 2014, where he ate scorpion, which he said was “delicious.” Earlier this year, the U.S. government accused Matveev of participating in “a global ransomware campaign” against victims all over the world. Prosecutors claim Matveev is “a prolific ransomware affiliate,” who worked with the Hive, LockBit and Babuk ransomware gangs to carry out “significant attacks” against corporations and critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, including hospitals and government agencies. In particular, the feds said Matveev “allegedly intentionally infected” Matveev, however, said he actually isn’t affiliated with any ransomware group and that he only “rented their software for my own purposes.” Since the indictment and sanctions, he said, he has joked about the measures taken against him with people still involved in ransomware operations. “We sometimes throw memes at each other,” he said. He said he was using the ransomware to both test it in a controlled environment and to deploy it in real-life scenarios.",

While Motel One says the impact of the hack was kept to a “relative minimum” due to unspecified measures that the company took, it confirmed that attackers were able to access some customer data. According to Motel One, this includes address data and the content of 150 credit cards. Motel One’s statement comes days after the company was listed on the dark web leak site of the ALPHV ransomware gang. The group claims to have stolen several terabytes of data from the company, including some customer information. TechCrunch has seen some of the data, which the ransomware gang alleges to be employee and some customer information. Motel One spokesperson Inken Mende did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions. It’s not yet known how the company was compromised or how it purportedly thwarted the attack. Motel One claims its business operations were “never at risk” due to the incident. News of the Motel One attack comes weeks after MGM Resorts, which operates several hotels and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, was targeted by Scattered Spider, a hacking group believed to be a subgroup of the ALPHV ransomware gang. MGM has yet to confirm whether the attack, which caused widespread disruption across its resorts, led to the compromise of customer data.",

To stay current with what the working world is thinking about most these days, and to keep its nearly 1 billion users engaging on its platform, today the company is unveiling a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns. The social platform — which pulled in $15 billion in revenues last year, a spokesperson tells me — has been slowly putting in a number of AI-based features across its product portfolio. Among them, back in March it debuted AI-powered writing suggestions for those penning messages to other users on the platform. And recruiters have also been seeing a series of tests around AI-created job descriptions and other features this year. This latest raft of announcements is building on that. For some context, LinkedIn is not entirely new to the AI rodeo. It has, in fact, been a heavy user of artificial intelligence over the years. But until recently most of that has been out of sight. Ever been surprised (or unnerved) at how the platform suggests connections to you that are strangely right up your street? That’s AI. All those insights that LinkedIn produces about what its user base is doing and how it’s evolving? That’s AI, too. And what’s also changed is that LinkedIn — which has in the past built a lot of its own AI tooling for all those back-end operations — is now leaning out. The company, which was acquired by Microsoft some years ago, is tapping tech from OpenAI and Microsoft to power a number of its new features, it confirmed to me.",

        "content": "Dry Studio says the Black Diamond 75’s design was inspired by the Lamborghini Aventador Carbonado from Mansory. The design does lean heavily on the car’s carbon fiber look, especially with its built-in wristrest on the black model, though beyond that, I admit I don’t see much of a likeness. Like with the inspirations of Angry Miao’s keyboards, I find it best to ignore all of that and judge the board for what it is. Let’s talk about the design first, because this is definitely not your average cookie-cutter keyboard — and I wouldn’t expect anything less from a studio that’s affiliated with Angry Miao. The board features a see-through acrylic top that allows the design to emphasize the leaf springs — a system Dry Studio brought over from Angry Miao. The “carbon” black version, which Dry Studio sent me to try, features gold springs. Dry Studio uses pre-lubed Gateron screw-in stabilizers for the larger keys and, at least in the model I tested, there was zero rattle. Indeed, the pre-lubing on both the switches and the stabilizers is top-notch. To accent the design, Dry Studio added carbon fiber elements around the board. The most obvious is the built-in wristrest on the black model, which also features built-in LED “headlights” (which you can turn off, if you prefer). Whether you like that aesthetic is a matter of taste, but by Angry Miao standards, the design is almost restrained. Dry Studio powers all of this with a 5,000mAh battery, which the company says should last for 60 days with LEDs disabled and eight hours of daily usage. I haven’t had the board long enough to test that, but I have used it wirelessly for well over a week without any issues. There is also wireless Qi charging (on the $295 Advance edition), too, and since we’re still in the Angry Miao ecosystem, that’ll work nicely with the Cybermat. Overall, though, the Black Diamond 75 is an easy recommendation. At this price, there really isn’t a board on the market that has the same design wow factor and build quality. In many ways, it’s the board I always hoped Angry Miao would make. One that combines the group’s mechanical keyboard expertise and high build quality with a more standard layout and at a more affordable price. That price, it’s worth noting, even undercuts some of Razer’s recent gaming keyboards, and while I’m sure those work great, too, their design isn’t going to win any prizes.",

       "content": "DoorDash has made a name for itself as a restaurant delivery service that has in later years expanded to categories like groceries and convenience store items. But the company is now running a test of a surprising new feature: a rewards program that offers consumers credits for dining out at local restaurants. The feature, called simply “Dine Out,” allows users to earn credits by swiping to “check in” while they’re at a restaurant. As a page on DoorDash’s customer support site explains, the amount of the credit varies and will be stated in the offer. Plus, if a restaurant has multiple locations, the credit may be limited to certain locations. Customers are also limited to one eligible restaurant per day. “DoorDash constantly innovates and tests new in-app features to provide customers with best-in-class experiences, while providing restaurant partners with new ways to increase their revenue,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. “A limited number of customers in select markets may see Dine Out deals, where they can receive discounts after dining in at select restaurants,” they noted. Essentially, the app would serve as lead gen for DoorDash restaurant partners — and potentially a way to onboard restaurants to the platform that have hesitated to offer delivery services through the app, too. Given the small-scale nature of the test, it’s unclear if or when the Dine Out program will expand across the U.S., but it may be worth launching the app to see if it’s available in your city.",

One thing that rarely makes this list is thinking about the balance sheet. After all, no great company was founded on the bedrock of capital efficiency. And CFOs have better things to think about (see monthly burn and runway). Does it really matter if working capital is efficient? If the startup is running a positive cash conversion cycle? If it’s capturing market yields? For a young, pre-product-market-fit company, the answer has always been, and remains, no. Focus on product-market fit. Make customers want what you have to sell. Make them rip if off the shelves. Once you get the formula right, you can worry about capital efficiency. Until then, conserve burn, extend runway, and try to hit the witchcraft of product-market fit. For a scaling company in 2020 and 2021, the answer was, “It’s doesn’t really matter.” Risk-free yields were at less than 50 bp (a bp, pronounced “bip,” is 1/100th of a percent; 50 bp is 0.5%). Why bother? So you run a bit more efficient and make a few thousands of dollars/pounds/euros. That’s one kit for a new engineering hire. Gone in a heartbeat. For a scaling company, in Q4 2023, the answer is a strong yes. Why? Two reasons: You have meaningful capital at hand. Your raise probably wasn’t $5 million. Your balance sheet runs past the seventh digit. No matter where in the world you are, your local federal bank (whether the fed in the U.S., the BoE in the U.K. or the ECB in the EU) is paying you for capital efficiency.",

        "content": "After launching its “Paid Stories” program in 2019, the social storytelling platform Wattpad is now replacing it with a new freemium model called “Wattpad Originals” that gives authors the best of both worlds — monetization and growing their audience of non-paying readers. With the new model, authors can hide certain chapters behind a paywall while also allowing readers to access free content and try before they buy. Wattpad Originals is invite-only and consists of top-tier content selected by editorial experts based on reader engagement metrics. Readers can support their favorite writers by unlocking chapters with coins (the cost depends on word count) or by paying for a Wattpad Premium+ subscription for $7.49 per month.  Wattpad’s sister platform that specializes in digital comics, rolled out a similar pay-to-read-ahead or wait-to-read-for-free model in the U.S. in 2019. From 2020 to 2022, the program paid out more than $27 million to English-language comic artists. n the last five years alone, Wattpad’s creator opportunities — which also include brand partnerships and creator program stipends — have paid out nearly $10 million to authors, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Wattpad has invested in many tools and writing initiatives to help authors be successful on the platform. Most recently, a new Publishing Scheduler Tool allows authors to schedule stories and publish more consistently. The company also revamped its Creators Program by adding new educational resources like the Story School series.",

        "content": "Automata, a company that combines software and hardware to automate science labs around the globe, has raised $40 million in an equity-based round of funding, as the U.K.-based startup looks to double down on recent growth across Europe and the U.S. Founded out of London in 2015, Automata in its original guise targeted myriad industries seeking to automate repetitive manual tasks using a configurable, desktop-based robotic arm dubbed Eva. However, in the intervening years the company discovered that serving smaller, individualized use cases simply wasn’t going to scale into a meaningful business. So they went back to the drawing board and identified sectors that were on the brink of an automation revolution, ones that were ripe for full — rather than partial — automation. Thus, Automata 2.0 was born, constituting a new hardware and software stack capable of connecting and integrating the different steps involved in lab-based experimentation and testing, with a specific focus on genomics and cell biology use cases. The Automata platform consists of a cloud-based software called LINQ, which allows users to integrate their different instruments and design, schedule and run their various workflows. This is then combined with the robotic LINQ bench, which physically transports labware (e.g. test tubes and similar equipment) across the benchtop. The bench is modular, and thus can be configured to different lab setups, with additional robotic arms and related componentry added as required. Ultimately, Automata is all about solving the same types of problems that automation seeks to solve in every industry: reducing tedious manual tasks, reducing error rates and increasing capacity and output — in the case of Automata, this means improving drug development and testing timelines. Automata’s latest funding round was led by U.S.-based venture capital firm Dimension, with participation from Octopus Ventures, Hummingbird, Isomer Capital, Possible Ventures, Aldea Ventures and A.P. Moller Holding — the parent company of the A.P. Moller Group, which acquired laboratory testing group Unilabs back in 2021.",

        "content": "Meta is to offer an ad-free subscription version of Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, confirming the core of a report in the WSJ earlier this month. The new ad-free subscription will be available from next month, per a Meta blog post. The move follows years of privacy litigation, enforcements and court rulings in the EU — which have culminated in a situation where Meta can no longer claim a contractual right (nor legitimate interest) to track and profile users for ad targeting. (Although, at the time of writing, it is still doing the latter — meaning it is technically operating without a proper legal basis. But this summer Meta announced an intention to switch to consent.) Under regional data protection law the only available basis left for Meta’s tracking and profiling ad business is to obtain freely given consent from users. However the adtech giant’s interpretation of free consent with this ‘pay us or be tracked’ subscription proposal will, justifiably, leave privacy advocates fuming — since the choice it’s offering here boils down to ‘pay us money; or pay us with your privacy’. Per Meta’s blog post, the fee it plans to charge users to escape its tracking and targeting (i.e. the ad-free subscription) is €9.99/month on web or €12.99/month on iOS or Android per linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user’s Accounts Center. After March 1, 2024 it also says an additional fee — of €6/month on web and €8/month on iOS or Android — will apply for each additional account listed in a user’s Account Center. So the cost for using Meta’s services without being tracked and profiled could quickly stack up for anyone with more than one account on Meta’s social networks. Even for a user with just one account (on either Facebook or Instagram) the cost for protecting their privacy from Meta’s tracking and profiling would be almost €120 per year (for web use) or just over €155 (on mobile). As we reported earlier this month, Meta is relying on a line in a ruling handed down by the bloc’s top court, the CJEU, earlier this year — where the judges allowed the possibility — caveated with “if necessary” — of an (another caveat) “appropriate fee” being charged for an equivalent alternative service (i.e. that lacks tracking and profiling). So the legal fight against Meta’s continued tracking and profiling of users will hinge on what’s necessary and appropriate in this context.",

However, during that time, the company reached profitability in August and is approaching seven figures of annual recurring revenue, Pati said. It also calls more than 100 business customers, including BMW, Invisalign, Zillow and Bill.com. “What we want to do is create something that has the form factors that can be used by every mainstream American business, from small business to enterprise,” Pati said. “By doing so, we’re going to have to create very custom workflows.

It’s his belief that many existing solutions — e.g. spreadsheets and even software-as-a-service tools — require founders to handle an outsize amount of the management and accounting work manually, and often end up complicating rather than streamlining back-of-office processes. So Varma launched Ten Key Labs, a platform that taps AI to try to reduce the burden of managing company equity stakes across platforms. Ten Key Labs can set up approvals and templates in a few clicks, Varma claims, issuing reminders for outstanding actions. “I saw an opportunity to tap my understanding of what a founder really needs and combine that with the latest in AI to give founders a tool that lets them focus on building their companies by giving back time and easing their mental burden,” Varma told TechCrunch in an email interview. Using Ten Key Labs, founders can track and organize their startup’s cap table — the table that shows each investors’ equity capital stake in the business — and use predictive tools to model their hiring and financing needs. They can also issue equity, managing the various stakeholders — e.g. employees, employees, investors and board members — and approval workflows in one place. Ten Key Labs isn’t liberal in its use of AI. But it applies it where it makes sense — as a “co-pilot” for corporate-related tasks, Varma says. For example, the platform can automatically convert stock options in an offer letter approved by a company’s board of directors, which tends to be a source of costly “clean-up” time for lawyers when it comes to financing and exits. “The challenge is, founders and operators generally don’t fully understand the cost of equity in the allocation equation,” Varma said. “By having a fully transparent and collaborative platform around equity management, the various stakeholders are able to collaborate and understand the impact of their decisions.”",

Originally focused on hardware startup investments, HCVC quickly evolved to invest in deep tech startups in general, such as companies working on climate, biotech, robotics, space, etc. Some of HCVC’s portfolio companies include electric bike maker Cowboy, nuclear fusion tech company Renaissance Fusion, Span, Caper, Automata, Radia and Augmenta. The name HCVC itself comes from the Hardware Club, a community of hardware and deep tech companies that share knowledge and help each other through the network. There are more than 600 companies in the club. This Hardware Club has never been a way to make money directly. HCVC isn’t an investor in every company in the Hardware Club. Since 2018, the firm has backed 50 companies with its original $50 million fund. With HCVC’s new fund, the VC firm plans to conduct up to 40 investments, which means roughly 10 deals per year. On average, HCVC will be able to invest anything between €250,000 and €2.5 million per deal ($260,000 to $2.6 million). “We want to back founders that create a future with more clean energy, more powerful computing, more context-aware robots, better defense tools for democracies and biomanufacturing that enables us to decarbonize food production,” HCVC founder and managing partner Alexis Houssou said in a statement. In addition to Houssou, Jerry Yang, Aymerik Renard and Alex Flamant are the three other partners in the fund. Alex Flamant is a recent addition to the team. He was a principal at Singular, another Paris-based VC firm. He also spent some time at Notion Capital. As for the limited partners, HCVC raised money from the European Investment Fund, Isomer Capital and Molten Ventures, as well as several individual investors, such as Albert Wenger (managing partner at USV), John Elkann (chairman of Stellantis and Ferrari) and Toto Wolff (team principal and CEO of Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team). Interestingly, HCVC also says that its fund is exclusively backed by European, American and Japanese investors — unlike many U.S. VC firms, there’s no Saudi Arabian investor participation.",

        "content": "New York–based privacy and security startup Cloaked launched its apps today to let users create unique proxy emails, phone numbers, and passwords for online accounts. The company, which was in private beta for the last two years, is now making its solution available for everyone through its web app, Chrome extension, and mobile apps (available on both Android and iOS). Cloaked, founded by brothers Arjun and Abhijay Bhatnagar in 2020, allows users to create “identities” consisting of usernames, passwords, email addresses, and phone numbers. People can use these identities for different categories of websites such as e-commerce, social media, and newsletters, where they can avoid giving up their actual content. The service costs $10 per month or $100 per year, with a free trial of 14 days. This subscription gives users the ability to create unlimited identities. While Cloaked has all the password manager functionality built into the app, the startup is aiming to be much more than that. Just like Apple’s Hide My Email, it masks your real email — with Cloaked, you can also customize email addresses. Plus, if you don’t want emails to be forwarded to your ID, Cloaked can act as your inbox — unlike Firefox Relay, which just hides your email. Additionally, Cloaked will let you autofill different forms online through various identities you have stored, including one-time passwords sent to the service’s inbox. You can also create Google Voice–like virtual numbers to use for SMS or signing up for services. Currently, the virtual phone number functionality is only available in the U.S. The co-founders said that under the hood, Cloaked acts like a phone company. “We don’t use Twilio or these things; we are actually a proper phone company working with a tier-one carrier. We purchase, acquire, and manage all the routing, for phone numbers. Similarly, we do the entire email routing rather than creating thin email aliases,” they said. With the launch of its apps, Cloaked is also introducing a feature called “AutoCloak,” which essentially masks your existing credentials with a set of proxy credentials, by automatically changing your password after you sign in using the saved password. The company said this feature is available only on a limited number of sites and users are in full control of it in terms of activating or deactivating the AutoCloak feature. ",

       "content": "Content moderation continues to be a contentious topic in the world of online media. New regulations and public concern are likely to keep it as a priority for many years to come. But weaponized AI and other tech advances are making it ever harder to address. A startup out of Cambridge, England, called Unitary AI believes it has landed on a better way to tackle the moderation challenge — by using a “multimodal” approach to help parse content in the most complex medium of all: video. Today, Unitary is announcing $15 million in funding to capitalize on momentum it’s been seeing in the market. The Series A — led by top European VC Creandum, with participation also from Paladin Capital Group and Plural — comes as Unitary’s business is growing. The number of videos it is classifying has jumped this year to 6 million/day from 2 million (covering billions of images) and the platform is now adding on more languages beyond English. It declined to disclose names of customers but says ARR is now in the millions. Unitary is using the funding to expand into more regions and to hire more talent. Unitary is not disclosing its valuation; it previously raised under $2 million and a further $8 million in seed funding; other investors include the likes of Carolyn Everson, the ex-Meta exec. There have been dozens of startups over recent years harnessing different aspects of artificial intelligence to build content moderation tools. And when you think about it, the sheer scale of the challenge in video is an apt application for it. No army of people would alone ever be able to parse the tens and hundreds of zettabytes of data that are being created and shared on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Reddit or TikTok — to say nothing of dating sites, gaming platforms, videoconferencing tools, and other places where videos appear, altogether making up more than 80% of all online traffic. That angle is also what interested investors. “In an online world, there’s an immense need for a technology-driven approach to identify harmful content,” said Christopher Steed, chief investment officer, Paladin Capital Group, in a statement.

        "content": "In a victory for Tesla, a California federal judge ruled over the weekend that a group of Tesla owners cannot pursue in court claims that the company falsely advertised its automated features. Instead, they will have to face individual arbitration. U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam’s ruling isn’t a win for the defensibility of Tesla’s advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), but simply for Tesla’s terms and conditions. The plaintiffs who filed the proposed class action in September 2022 did in fact agree to arbitrate any legal claims against the company when they signed on the dotted line, according to the judge. They had 30 days to opt out, and none chose to do so. Forced arbitration has been a stalwart partner in the tech industry. Tesla’s success in dodging a class action lawsuit could encourage other automakers to lean more heavily on this tactic. “In some respects, it probably does put down a marker that these types of claims will likely face these types of challenges,” Ryan Koppelman, partner at law firm Alston & Bird, told TechCrunch. Koppelman noted that arbitration is a common legal strategy used by companies to avoid individual claims and class actions like this one. In this specific case, a fifth plaintiff did opt out of arbitration, but Judge Gilliam ruled to dismiss their claims, as they waited too long to sue, according to court documents. “The statue of limitation aspect is interesting because the claims at issue here had to do with what the Tesla products will be capable of in the future, as well as what they were supposedly capable of at the time of sale,” said Koppelman. The plaintiffs in the case all claimed to have spent thousands of dollars on unreliable and dangerous technology that has caused accidents, some resulting in death. Tesla has denied wrongdoing and moved to send the claims to arbitration, after citing the plaintiffs’ acceptance of the arbitration agreement. ",

        "content": "Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are the latest versions of Google’s smartphone technology, with the company touting, “They’re fast and secure phones with Google AI and the most advanced Pixel Cameras yet.” At 6.1 inches, the Pixel 8’s display is a fraction of an inch smaller than its predecessor, while the Pixel 8 Pro retains its 6.8 inches. The 8’s resolution is the same as before at 1080 x 2400, while the 8 Pro actually loses a bit of Pixel density from 512 to 489 ppi at 1344 x 2992. The biggest benefit to the new Actua display (or Super Actua, in the case of the Pro) is extreme brightness. The 8 peaks out at 2,000 nits and the 8 Pro at 2,400. Both screens have a 120hz peak refresh rate. The latest version of the Android handset starts at $699 for the 8 and $999 for the 8 Pro Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 8 Pro upgrades include the display, the glass with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and a bunch on the camera. Darrell Etherington’s first impression: “Google has taken a very iterative approach to this year’s model, but the upgraded camera specs and the new Tensor G3 processor that powers the Pixel 8 Pro look to be where a lot of the benefits of upgrading lie.” Speaking of the camera, two of the new features include Magic Editor, which enables background filling and subject repositioning, and Best Take, which combines multiple shots to create the best group photo  Google finally released its first smartwatch last year, to mixed reviews. Now it is getting some upgrades. The biggest changes? Improved heart rate monitoring and the addition of a pair of new sensors designed to give the device a fuller picture of its wearer. Also, the addition of a body-response sensor and skin temperature sensor are borrowed from the Fitbit line and bring along new stress management features Google’s update of the Pixel Buds Pro includes features like conversation detection — which is similar to Apple’s conversation awareness features for AirPods — listening stats, and support for Bluetooth Super Wideband for better sound quality on calls. The Android 14 mobile operating system comes with new customization options, accessibility features and more this year. The OS will begin rolling out to supported Pixel devices today and then to other Android devices later this year. Highlights include switching between wallpapers to quickly make changes to what you want to see at a glance and more easily set custom lock screen shortcuts. ",

        "content": "Google is updating Pixel Buds Pro this fall with features like conversation detection — which is similar to Apple’s conversation awareness features for AirPods — listening stats and support for Bluetooth Super Wideband for better sound quality on calls. The company announced at its Pixel event today that the Pixel Buds Pro uses AI to detect when you start speaking and reduces the background noise by switching to the transparency mode. Once you’re done talking music resumes and the buds switch back to active noise cancellation mode. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, an Apple exec said that the Conversational Awareness feature, which was rolled out through the iOS 17 update, uses the movement of jaws through an accelerometer to detect talking, apart from using the mic to pick up sound. It’s not clear if Google is using similar techniques. The new Pixel Buds Pro update also makes the earbuds compatible with Bluetooth Super Wideband. The company claims that if you use them with a Pixel phone, your voice quality for calls will be better for the other person because of the extra bandwidth. Google is also rolling out a low-latency gaming mode, which cuts audio latency in half for select games. Competitors such as OnePlus have had a low latency mode for their earbuds when paired with their own phones for a while. The company is also rolling out listening stats for you to know how loud you have been listening to music, with suggestions to lower the volume. Additionally, Google is releasing a Pixel Buds Pro web app for Chromebooks to let you change settings or install firmware updates. While there is no Pixel Buds Pro sequel this year, Google is releasing two new colors — Bay and Porcelain — for the earbuds. ",

        "content": "After years of rumors and reports, Google finally released its first smartwatch last year. It was a long overdue debut for the company behind the nearly 10-year-old Wear OS. Getting there required the company to build a team and make some strategic acquisitions including, most notably, the Fitbit deal that closed in 2021. The Pixel watch arrived to mixed reviews. Google was, after all, entering a mature space, competing not only against the massively successful Apple Watch, but also the No. 2 Samsung, which had recently started running Wear OS on its own devices. Health tracking was, unsurprisingly, a core function. It has, after all, been largely regarded as the key driver of smartwatch purchases and use. Also unsurprising was the role that the Fitbit acquisition played, effectively letting the company hit the ground running. Announced at this morning’s Google hardware event in Manhattan, the Pixel Watch 2 doesn’t represent much of a departure from its predecessor. In fact, it’s hard to distinguish the two. The sequel is more about refining the formula and introducing a few new tricks into the mix. The biggest changes this time out are improved heart rate monitoring and the addition of a pair of new sensors designed to give the device a fuller picture of its wearer. The addition of a body-response sensor and skin temperature sensor are borrowed from the Fitbit line and bring along new stress management features. ",

It weighs 13.3 lbs, which is more than two pounds lighter than the Wacom Cintiq Pro 24. The color rendering covers 99% Adobe RGB, and 93% DCI-P3, and it’s both Pantone and Pantone SkinTone Validated. There’s a 178-degree viewing angle for generous off-axis viewing, and it has 8,192 levels of pressure detection. The display is mostly reflection-free thanks to its etched glass matte surface, which also helps it feel a lot like drawing on traditional paper media. As mentioned, Xencelabs also includes two dfferent pens right in the box, including one with three buttons and a thicker grip, as well as a thin pen that’s lighter in the hand; both pens include erasers and there are a range of nibs in the box, including both standard and those designed to mimic felt nibs. Another included accessory is Xencelabs’ Quick Keys controller, which has a built-in two-tone OLED display. This features a number of customizable buttons that control common functions in drawing, painting and photo-editing apps, like undo/redo, zoom/pan and much more. These can be set on a per-app basis or tailored to your needs, and the OLED readout offers a lot of added convenience versus Wacom’s ExpressKeys, which has no integrated display. Xencelabs also bundles the display with a tilting stand that gives you plenty of options for using it both mostly upright as a traditional screen, or at a range of different angles comfortable for drawing on a desktop surface. Wacom, by contrast, only includes two integrated kickstand feet with the Cintiq Pro 24, which gives you just one slightly inclined angle for drawing without purchasing additional stand or arm-mounting options. The bezels on the tablet are generous enough to make you feel like you’ve got room to maneuver without blocking what you’re working on, but they still put the screen in focus. The screen is also flush with the bezels, and all of the above are covered with that etched glass for a smooth, continuous modern look.",

        "content" : "Humane, a stealthy software and hardware company, is clearly milking the media hype cycle for all it’s worth. The company’s origin dates all the way back to 2017, when it was founded by former Apple employees Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri. In the intervening half-decade, the firm has been largely shrouded in mystery, as it has put together the pieces of a mystery wearable, which it promises will leverage AI in unique ways. At the tail end of 2020, it raised a $30 million Series A at a $150 million valuation. The $100 million B round arrived the following September, including Tiger Global Management, SoftBank Group, BOND, Forerunner Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures. It all seemed like a strong vote of confidence for the still stealthy firm. This March, it went ahead and raised another $100 million. In June, Humane revealed that its inaugural product would be an “Ai Pin.” “The [Ai Pin is a] connected and intelligent clothing-based wearable device uses a range of sensors that enable contextual and ambient compute interactions,” the company noted at the time. “The Ai Pin is a type of standalone device with a software platform that harnesses the power of Ai to enable innovative personal computing experiences.” The Humane Ai Pin is the screenless, standalone device and software platform built from the ground up for AI. The intelligent clothing-based wearable uses a range of sensors that enable natural and intuitive compute interactions and is designed to weave seamlessly into users’ day-to-day lives. The device is privacy-first, with aspects such as no wake word and therefore no ‘always on’ listening, reflecting Humane’s vision of building products which place trust at the center. If that sounds like a bunch of buzzwords strung together, you’re not wrong. Until we actually see the thing functioning in-person, it’s impossible to untangle the final product from the self-generated hype. From what we can make out from the images, it’s definitely a screenless device, though the large front may have some functionality. Above that are what appear to be front-facing sensors, possibly coupled with additional sensors on the top, directed at the wearer’s face. Humane is really pushing the “standalone device” narrative, meaning some of the appeal here could be the ability to leave your smartphone at home — similar to what companies have pushed with LTE-enable smartwatches.",

The Meta Quest 3 is similar to its two predecessors and borrows a lot from the much more expensive Meta Quest Pro, but it improves upon all of the above in some key ways, and the result is something genuinely new and improved that stands to create a much larger tent for virtual and mixed reality in general. The things I did on the Meta Quest 3 weren’t astoundingly different from things I’ve tried in VR before: For reference, I’ve owned both the original Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, as well as the first-generation Quest. I skipped the second iteration, mostly because those other three devices, which in total represent a fairly significant cost, spent a huge amount of time either collecting dust on a shelf, or squirreled away in a closet to hide my great shame about how little I used them. The OG Quest also scratched my glasses but that’s another story. My first actual mixed-reality experience was a multiplayer game that allowed up to four players to join in and participate in a Smash-type 3D platform combat game, and it was actually incredibly fun. I played with a Meta handler as well as another journalist, and I trounced them both soundly. I won’t mention the other journalist to spare him the embarrassment. Later, I got to try out a longer, more varied demo with a lot of different test experiences, including some showing mixed reality and some showing more fully immersive experiences that were more similar to what I’ve tried before with past headsets. All were impressive, and even the full VR was much better than it has been due to the improved visual quality and processing power of this generation. What was maybe the best part about all of these demos, and about Zuck’s presentation of the Quest 3 overall, was that no one in the demo room ever mentioned the “metaverse,” and Mark only said the word twice during the entire keynote today — the first time 34 minutes into the presentation and long after the Quest 3 segment, and then again in passing about five minutes later.

        "content" : "The original Ray-Ban Stories didn’t catch on quite like Meta had hoped. According to a recent report, the company managed to sell a bit over one-third of what the internal 300,000 unit goal it set for the first seven months the device was on sale. Perhaps even more damning is a section from the same report suggesting that around 90% of owners had already abandoned the hardware. As always, there’s a lot at play here, but I suspect a big part of the disappointment can be traced back to the system’s limitations. For one thing, the Stories couldn’t stream video — a pretty key feature one hopes for when it comes to sunglasses with embedded cameras. I certainly won’t go so far as to suggest that the forthcoming Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are destined to be a runaway hit, but I will tell you that at the very least its creators addressed the biggest issue with their predecessor. Unveiled this morning at Meta Connect in Menlo Park, California, the new sunglasses are capable of livestreaming video to (naturally) Facebook and Instagram. The systems come in the standard classic Wayfarer design, along with a new Headliner style. They look like standard sunglasses (or eyeglasses, depending on the lens), save for two round modules on the side of either eye. On the right is a 12-megapixel camera that can take stills and record video in 1080p. The other side — that looks more or less identical (for symmetry’s sake) — is actually an LED light that flips on to alert others that you’re recording. The Ray-Ban Meta features open-ear speakers (not bone conduction) that are capable of getting 50% louder than their predecessors. We got our hands on some pairs at a recent Meta event, and I can attest to the fact that they can get to a comfortably loud volume. Something worth caveating all of this, of course, is the fact that we tested them in ideal conditions. The Ray-Ban Meta are up for preorder starting today in the following markets: U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Australia, Germany, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Sweden. They go on sale October 12 from Meta, LensCrafters, Amazon and Best Buy. The price starts at $299 for standard lenses. Polarized run $329 and transitions $379. Prescription lenses are on a sliding scale.",

One such announcement was the debut of Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service on Meta Quest 3, which is actually a huge boon for fans of the Facebook owner’s mixed reality gear. The Xbox Cloud Gaming implementation in Quest resembles a lot of how Apple showed its own vision for mixed reality with the Vision Pro headset: It’s primarily a virtual screen that can float in either a virtual or mixed reality space, which appears to be reposition-able and resizable, but which basically works exactly as you’d expect an Xbox game to work with a large TV. This is a key acknowledgement on the part of Meta that while immersive, native gaming is undoubtedly a draw for users; so too is a more traditional gaming experience that basically just benefits from taking place in your own private face-mounted theater. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that it’ll arrive some time in December, but didn’t provide a more specific date of when to expect the launch.",

        "content": "Meta announced today it’s rolling out its first generative AI features for advertisers, allowing them to use AI to create backgrounds, expand images and generate multiple versions of ad text based on their original copy. The launch of the new tools follows the company’s Meta Connect event last week where the social media giant debuted its Quest 3 mixed-reality headset and a host of other generative AI products, including stickers and editing tools, as well as AI-powered smart glasses. In the case of AI tools for the ad industry, the new products may not be as wild as the celebrity AIs that let you chat with virtual versions of people like MrBeast or Paris Hilton, but they showcase how Meta believes generative AI can assist the brands and businesses that are responsible for delivering the majority of Meta’s revenue. The first among the trio of new features allows an advertiser to customize their creative assets by generating multiple different backgrounds to change the look of their product images. This is similar to the technology that Meta used to create the consumer-facing tool Backdrop, which allows users to change the scene or the background of their image by using prompts. However, in the ad toolkit, the backgrounds are generated for the advertiser based on their original product images and will tend to be “simple backgrounds with colors and patterns,” Meta explains. The feature is available to those advertisers using the company’s Advantage+ catalog to create their sales ads. Another feature, image expansion, allows advertisers to adjust their assets to fit different aspect ratios required across various products, like Feed or Reels, for example. Also available to Advantage+ creative in Meta’s Mads Manager, the AI feature would allow advertisers to spend less time repurposing their creative assets, including images and video, for different surfaces, Meta claims. Meta says it’s already tested these AI features with a small but diverse set of advertisers earlier this year, and their early results indicate that generative AI will save them five or more hours per week, or a total of one month per year. However, the company admits that there’s still work ahead to better customize the generative AI output to match each advertiser’s style. ",

Over the years, that prediction has played out to a certain extent. More companies have embedded fintech, specifically payments, into their offerings. It’s no wonder then that infrastructure companies have proven so resilient even in the venture slowdown. But not everyone agrees with Strange’s prediction. Joshua Silver, CEO and founder of Atlanta-based Rainforest, told TechCrunch in an interview that he believes that every software platform wants to embed financial services and embed payments into their offerings. “But they don’t want to be a fintech themselves,” he said. “Being a fintech means you are highly regulated. You have risk management to contend with. You have compliance burdens. And the vast majority of software companies just want to add payments.”",

       "content": "It’s no secret that alternative protein companies and others leveraging fermentation technology have an issue scaling to commercial production. Founders say that this is perhaps the number one challenge to taking their products from expensive to cost parity with traditional meat. Meet Pow.bio, a company founded by Ouwei Wang and Shannon Hall (no relation to the author) in 2019, that aims to help synthetic biology companies manufacture their products at cost parity amid a market of biomade products estimated to reach $4 trillion by 2040. Biology is the technology of today, Hall told TechCrunch. “We see that in lots of consumer-facing goods, and lots of biomedicines and in Impossible Foods products. More importantly, it’s behind our aspirations for how we’re going to deal with some of the biggest challenges in the world. For example, climate change impacts, population growth impacts and our aspirations to live and travel in space. All of that is predicated on having biology technology working. While companies like No Meat Factory, Planetary and Prolific Machines raised capital to build production facilities, Hall said the solution to the scaling problem won’t come from building large-scale bioreactors, even if the funding comes from the government. The real true story here is that most of the biology design stuff just is too damn expensive to take to the market, Hall added. Building bigger bioreactors doesn’t make that better, and as a result, what you see made are things you either need very tiny amounts of, like the heme protein in the Impossible Burger, or things that are crazy expensive, like lactoferrin, or human collagen, which is also nice to have alternatives.",

The facility provides up to $100 million in financing capacity and will support $850 million of Clearco originations over the next two years. Toronto-based Clearco uses AI and proprietary machine learning-based technology to underwrite businesses and help customers fund inventory and marketing invoices of between $10,000 and $2 million. To date, the company has financed over 10,000 companies with more than $2.5 billion. The company was founded as Clearbanc in 2015, and provided capital to e-commerce founders growing their businesses without equity dilution, hidden fees or compounding cost of capital. The recapitalization marks a turnaround for a company that’s had its share of ups and downs over the past year. However, after the original story went out this morning, I was tipped that some layoffs occurred Wednesday, suggesting the company’s “downs” are not over yet: The company confirmed via email that it was not a mass reduction in labor, but that it did let go of six employees in what it called, “a single-digit restructuring for redundant roles.” The company also said “we are moving into growth mode and have an open headcount of approximately 10 roles. This was a very small restructuring as we recalibrated the business after the transactions closed.",

        "content": "What if you could interact with any piece of software using natural language? Imagine typing in a prompt and having AI translate the instructions into machine-comprehensible commands, executing tasks on a PC or phone to accomplish the goal that you just described? That’s the idea behind Rabbit, a rebranding of Cyber Manufacture Co., which is building a custom, AI-powered UI layer designed to sit between a user and any operating system. Founded by Jesse Lyu, who holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the University of Liverpool, and Alexander Liao, previously a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Rabbit is creating a platform, Rabbit OS, underpinned by an AI model that can — so Lyu and Liao claim — see and act on desktop and mobile interfaces the same ways that humans can. “The advancements in generative AI have ignited a wide range of initiatives within the technology industry to define and establish the next level of human-machine interaction,” Lyu told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Our perspective is that the ultimate determinant of success lies in delivering an exceptional end-user experience. Drawing upon our past endeavors and experiences, we’ve realized that revolutionizing the user experience necessitates a bespoke and dedicated platform and device. This fundamental principle underpins the current product and technical stack chosen by Rabbit.” Rabbit — which has $20 million in funding contributed by Khosla Ventures, Synergis Capital and Kakao Investment, which a source familiar with the matter says values the startup at between $100 million and $150 million — isn’t the first to attempt layering a natural language interface on top of existing software. Google’s AI research lab, DeepMind, has explored several approaches for teaching AI to control computers, for example having an AI observe keyboard and mouse commands from people completing “instruction-following” tasks such as booking a flight. Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University recently open sourced a web-navigating AI agent that they claim can figure out how to do things like use a search engine and order items online. Elsewhere, there are apps like the viral Auto-GPT, which tap AI startup OpenAI’s text-generating models to act “autonomously,” interacting with apps, software and services both online and local, like web browsers and word processors.",

This week, it’s Okta’s turn. The identity company is making a slew of AI-related announcements at the company’s Oktane customer conference, taking place this week in San Francisco. “I think AI is the next big wave in technology. I think it’s as important and big and impactful as the internet, as cloud, as mobile,” Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told TechCrunch. For Okta, that means training a model on all of the data it’s been collecting about identity and putting that to work to help make customers safer. “We have a new set of capabilities we’re launching called Okta AI,” he said. “It’s taking all of the really, really valuable data we have from risk signals and usage patterns and customers and policies, and combining them with the latest and greatest AI technology.” As McKinnon points out, Okta AI isn’t a product per se, so much as a set of capabilities that will be added over time across the platform, some of which will incorporate predictive AI to help security teams understand possible threats, and some of which will allow users to interact with the data to pinpoint problems more easily using generative AI. While this will involve many different pieces, he highlighted three in particular. The first, Identity Threat Protection, looks at traditional identity protection, checking for things like the computer, network, location and other clues to ensure the person signing in is who they say they are — but it doesn’t stop there. “With Identity Threat Protection with Okta, AI, the evaluation of your security posture doesn’t stop. It’s continuously getting signals from the entire ecosystem — from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks or Zscalar or anyone else — and this is integrated with identity fraud protection. The second that there’s any kind of risk anywhere, whether it’s malware on the device or a bad network security posture, [it can identify it],” McKinnon said.",

        "content": "Physical security keys remain one of the best ways to secure user accounts, but the fact that new users have to register them before they can use them often adds quite a bit of friction. Yubico, the company behind the ubiquitous FIDO-certified YubiKeys, is now making this significantly easier by giving its enterprise users the ability to send pre-registered keys to employees. When they receive their new keys, all they have to do is navigate to their company’s web application or identity providers’ login page, enter a PIN provided by their IT department and that’s that. The new FIDO Pre-reg service is now in a limited access period, specifically for Okta customers in the U.S. (the company is making the announcement at Oktane, Okta’s user conference). As of now, interested users must purchase keys through Yubico’s YubiEnterprise Subscription program and use Okta Identity Engine (OIE), Okta Adaptive MFA (AMFA) and Okta Workflows. For now, the program will include the YubiKey5 NFC and YubiKey 5C NFC keys. At general availability, the program will support all of the company’s keys. “Organizations have historically been challenged to accelerate user adoption of phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO passkey solutions like YubiKeys at speed and scale,” said Jeff Wallace, senior vice president, Product, at Yubico. “Typically, administrators manually register YubiKeys on behalf of each employee before delivering to them in-office or shipping the key to the employee’s location. FIDO Pre-reg eliminates these challenges and provides a quick and easy way to adopt phishing resistance throughout a company on day one with turnkey YubiKey activation — all while reducing IT costs.” In an interview last month, Yubico co-founder Stina Ehrensvärd told me that the company is now building more than a million YubiKeys per month. Only a few years ago, it was producing about 200,000 per month. In part, the company has been able to increase production, which is mostly happening in Yubico’s home country of Sweden, because it has invested heavily in automation. “For many years at Yubico, we did not have enough stock,” she told me. “We’d run out of keys on our web store and people had to wait. That problem is behind us for now — until we get more orders — but at this time, we have plenty in stock and it’s very reassuring to know that we can actually make big volumes, good quality, high security, and with good margins.”",

Founder and CEO Ben Leventhal says that the proceeds, which bring Blackbird’s total raised to $35 million, will be put toward helping Blackbird scale its operations. “The restaurant business model is broken,” Leventhal told TechCrunch in an email interview. “It can be really expensive to remain at the top of a sea of competition. Operational costs are also at an all-time high, and restaurants need revenue. There’s only two paths forward: creating new revenue streams or creating regulars who’ll want to come back.” To Leventhal’s point, a 2022 survey from the National Restaurant Association (NRA) found that 54% of restaurant owners had to reduce the size of their dishes in response to rising food costs. A further 47% of the respondents said that they had to increase menu prices, as well. And restaurant failure rates aren’t exactly declining. Restaurants have about a 20% success rate, according to the NRA, with about 60% failing within the first year and 80% failing within five years of opening. Leventhal is perhaps best known for co-founding Eater, the food and drink publication (acquired by Vox in 2013), and Resy, the restaurant reservation service (acquired by American Express — which is also a Blackbird investor — in 2019). He came up with the idea for Blackbird in the early days of the pandemic after noticing that restaurants were finding innovative ways, like rolling out clothing lines and selling pancake mix, to keep customers engaged. “I was struck by the ingenuity of restaurants, who used their brands and audience to create sales streams that weren’t food,” Leventhal said. “This led me to start thinking about other ways restaurants could combat the serious business challenges of declining margins and eroding direct customer relationships. ”",

Jon Bratseth, previously a VP architect in the big data and AI group at Yahoo and one of the main contributors to Vespa, has been appointed CEO. Yahoo says it’ll continue to invest in Vespa (with cash) and remain its largest customer following the spinout. Yahoo will also own a stake in Vespa and hold a seat on the spun-out firm’s board of directors. Yahoo created Vespa back in 2005 after acquiring paid search service provider Overture, and, through it, a Norwegian search engine called AlltheWeb.com. Working with the e-commerce division within Yahoo, the AllTheWeb team of roughly 30 people retooled their search tech into a more general-purpose tool that Yahoo developers could use internally to compute over large-scale datasets in real time. Over the next decade or so, Yahoo expanded Vespa along several directions, enabling the tool to handle input beyond text strings, personalize content based on users’ click-through histories and take direction from machine learning algorithms. Then, in 2017, Yahoo open sourced Vespa, hoping to rally developer support behind the software — and foster something of an ecosystem both internally and externally. It was arguably Yahoo’s biggest open source software release since Hadoop in 2006, involving a substantial rewrite of the Vespa codebase by the Vespa group, still based in Norway. And it evidently paid off. Today, Vespa drives searches and related-article recommendations on Yahoo-owned sites and performs ad targeting on Yahoo-branded web properties such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo’s advertising network. Yahoo claims that it’s using around 150 apps created with Vespa and that these apps collectively serve a user base of a billion people — processing 800,000 queries per second.",

The company said that Uno’s team will help speed up the public launch of the Okta Personal tier, a password manager for consumers. Uno, founded by former Google engineer Parteek Saran, launched an app earlier this year to make password management easier for users through a design-centric approach. The company raised $3 million in funding from backers including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Lookout founder Kevin Mahaffey and Dug Song from Duo Security. The app’s main draw was to handle one-click login on the web by remembering your credentials for the site and even letting you quickly access a one-time code through the extension. Saran’s idea was to make security simple for users so they don’t have to worry a lot about password management. Okta mentioned that Uno will be discontinued as an app and the team will join the company to work on Okta Personal. The company didn’t give any content about the deal size. “The Uno team has deep experience building consumer-first, design-focused and easy-to-use password management and personal identity technologies. The addition of Uno’s talent and expertise in security, identity and AI allows us to accelerate the rollout of Okta Personal,” Vivek Raman, VP of Engineering at Okta, said in a statement. The enterprise identity management company said that it has been testing Okta Personal in beta since last year. The company noted that consumers based in the U.S. and Canada can sign up and start using it. Okta said it plans to expand the app’s availability to other countries soon. Okta Personal currently has a web app and an iOS app for password management. The app will also have features such as easy credential sharing and autofill. The app’s website suggests that the company is working on rolling out family sharing soon. The company didn’t specify if some of Uno’s features such as the easy reading of one-time passwords from email will be integrated into Okta Personal. It also didn’t say anything about Okta’s plan to migrate Uno’s existing user base. On its website, Uno said that the app will be discontinued from November 1.

        "content": "CoPilot, a digital training app that matches users with one-on-one remote fitness coaches, has raised $6.5 million in Series A-1 funding led by Jackson Square Ventures. The app, which has seen more than 1.5 million workouts completed on the platform, matches users with a coach they connect with in order to receive a custom fitness plan. The idea behind the company is to give users access to a personal coach for the fraction of the price of an in-person fitness trainer.The Pittsburgh-based startup was founded in 2019 by CEO Matt Spettel and CTO Gabriel Madonna. Spettel told TechCrunch in an interview that his personal journey with fitness is woven into the birth of CoPilot. He says he got into fitness when he was in high school after his best friend and now co-founder Madonna encouraged him to start working out. Spettel says he fell in love with taking care of his body as he underwent his personal fitness journey. The pair then starting tinkering with ideas in the fitness space while Spettel was studying at Carnegie Mellon and Madonna was at MIT. The duo’s first few ideas were quite different from where they are now, as they initially started building wearables and hardware devices designed to help gym enthusiasts optimize their workouts. “We built that product and threw it out into the world and saw what people had to say, and we had this realization,” Spettel said. “The problem to solve in fitness is not about optimizing an enthusiast’s workout, it’s helping the average person just know generally what to do and more importantly, helping them actually show up and do it. We became really focused on that problem, which led us to what CoPilot is today.” Since then the duo have been focused on building a product that gives people unlimited access to their own personal fitness coach. Spettel says that although access to an in-person personal trainer is great, it’s expensive and requires people to go to an actual gym, which is why CoPilot wants to make personal trainers more accessible. CoPilot’s target demographic are people who have a simple baseline of activity and are aware that exercise is important but have struggled to be consistent and hit their goals. CoPilot is available on both Android and iOS, and the service costs $99 per month. .",

         "content": "Mainstream social media platforms could face limits on their ability to take down independent journalism that violates their terms and conditions under a proposal agreed by European Union lawmakers yesterday. In a vote Tuesday, the European parliament set its negotiating position for upcoming talks with the Council on the bloc’s draft Media Freedom Act — taking aim at what MEPs called “arbitrary decisions by big platforms.” The text adopted by MEPs expands on the European Commission’s original proposal by setting out a requirement for larger platforms (i.e., very large online platforms, or VLOPs, with more than 45 million regional active monthly users) to give media services providers a heads-up of a planned takedown of their content — giving them 24 hours to reply to the objections before any restriction or suspension is imposed. The original Commission text merely urges these platforms to consider freedom and pluralism of media, act diligently and be transparent when they exercise editorial responsibility — that is, by taking down journalism they deem incompatible with their terms and conditions — and then, after the fact, provide an explanation of their actions to media service providers “as early as possible.” In the upcoming trilogue talks involving the Commission, the bloc’s co-legislators, the parliament, and the Council will need to negotiate to find a compromise on a final text so the shape of the law is not fixed in stone yet. And it remains to be seen whether the parliamentarians’ push for the Act to go further in safeguarding media from arbitrary decisions by larger platforms stands or falls. The parliament vote was a fairly substantial one in favor of the amended file — with 448 votes in favor versus 102 against (and 75 abstentions).",

        "content" : "The move toward open banking payments, especially in the EU, effectively kicked-off the fintech boom. Open banking standards meant that fintech startups could create wallets and effectively become banks, or at least “neo banks,” in practical day-to-day terms. Digital wallets are now the leading payment method globally in e-commerce, with a 49% share, according to the Global Payments Report by Worldpay. That said, so-called account-to-account (A2A) payments are on a streak, with the global A2A transaction value surpassing $525 billion in 2022, due to real-time payment rails now being available. There’s been a growing number of startups now taking advantage of this A2A boom, among them Trustly out of Stockholm, which to date has raised €23 million. However, they may now feel some heat from their other Stockholm-based neighbor, Brite Payments, which today announced a Series A fund-raise of $60 million led by specialist B2B software investor Dawn Capital. Also joining the round was global VC Headline (the re-branded e.ventures) out of their European practice Headline, and existing investor Incore (out of Sweden). Headline is made up of multiple seed and growth funds (in Europe, the U.S., Asia and Brazil) and in Europe it’s spread across Berlin, Paris and London. Prior to this round, Brite had raised seed cash from a smaller non-institutional investor Agof Investments, which is run by Marcus Blom alongside Nicolai Chamizo (Brite chairman and also Incore CEO). Brite, which only launched in 2019 and was founded by former Klarna exec Lena Hackelöer, had something of a breakout year in 2022, claiming to have doubled its transaction volume and revenue, and reached profitability. Its platform is now available in 25 countries across Europe, though not the U.K. (which is no longer an EU member).It’s worth noting that Dawn Capital was an early backer of other Swedish fintech leaders such as iZettle (sold to PayPal for $2.2 billion) and Tink (acquired by Visa for $2.0 billion). Headline has previously backed Pismo, the Brazilian payments infrastructure provider (which exited to Visa for $1.0 billion).",

         "content": "Krafton India has launched a gaming incubator in the South Asian nation as it seeks to expand the local ecosystem and support the domestic talent looking to enter the fast-growing gaming market. Called Krafton India Gaming Incubator (KIGI), the program aims to support six to 10 teams annually, with the total duration ranging from six months to a year. Selected participants will get guidance, mentorship, access to Krafton’s resources and financial support, typically between $50,000 and $150,000, depending on their needs, the company said on Wednesday. Krafton India, which recently relaunched the popular mobile title BGMI, said it would look for early-stage Indian startups and those at the conception stage, as well as student teams and independent developers for the KIGI program. The selected participants will be mentored by various gaming industry executives, game developers and industry experts from South Korea and India. Krafton will also offer the participants access to its internal resources, including data and market research, to help them build their respective products for the Indian markets worldwide. “Given the huge demand for gaming content [in India], the supply side has yet to mature. There are many great startups and small- to medium-sized and large-size game developers, but I think in the ecosystem, there is a lack of diversity,” said Sean Hyunil Sohn, CEO of Krafton India, in an interview. The South Korean company has appointed former Gameloft and Electronic Arts producer Anuj Sahani as the head of its incubator program. Sahani told TechCrunch that he, along with other executives at Krafton, will look for relevant participants by going through their applications and will pick the ones that fit the company’s global standards. To be sure, Sony and Epic Games also have incubation programs in various markets to support indie developers and early-stage startups. But those are limited to a specific gaming engine or platform, Sohn said, adding that Krafton’s program is game engine and platform agnostic, meaning the incubating teams can develop games using technologies based on their requirements and for platforms — not restricted to mobile that is dominating the gaming market in India — including PC and consoles.",

        "content": "Investors have historically been skeptical of green hydrogen. High production costs, expensive infrastructure builds, competition with batteries and minimal government support have made the green hydrogen sector a risky bet. But at least one company, Electric Hydrogen, seems to have found a way to convince investors that its tech is a bet they should take. Electric Hydrogen (EH2), a Massachusetts-based green hydrogen technology company, has just become green hydrogen’s first unicorn, with a $380 million Series C raise that brought its valuation up to $1 billion. That round also brought EH2’s total funding to roughly $600 million, per Crunchbase data. The startup is backed by heavy hitters like Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, United Airlines, BP and Fortescue Metals. The funds will be used to expand production capacity of its electrolyzers, according to a spokesperson for the company. Electrolyzers are devices that use a process called electrolysis to split water (H2O) into its constituent elements, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). They are expensive and consume tons of renewable energy to make a small amount of hydrogen. EH2 says it has figured out a way to produce more hydrogen at a cheaper price. Part of that apparent success is the company’s technology. EH2’s engineers designed and built all critical electrolyzer components in-house in the company’s Massachusetts lab. They increased performance to decrease costs, a move that came from Raffi Garabedian, EH2’s CEO and former chief technology officer at First Solar. Garabedian’s co-founder, Dave Eaglesham, was also a previous First Solar CTO. EH2 is also striking while the iron is hot. The startup is able to leverage its performance gains to get the most out of the incentives on offer with the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. EH2 says those offers will help to make green hydrogen that is actually competitive in today’s market and doesn’t use cheap natural gas to generate greenhouse-gas emissions. In parts of the country where renewables are cheap and tax credits outpace production costs, hydrogen could even be free to buyers. Much of the transportation world is embracing the battery-fueled revolution. But for big vehicles like trucks and planes, as well as industrial sites like steel mills, fertilizer factories and chemical plants, batteries aren’t the right fit. Green hydrogen is increasingly being seen as the solution to moving green power over long distances.",

       "content": "Meta announced today it’s rolling out its first generative AI features for advertisers, allowing them to use AI to create backgrounds, expand images and generate multiple versions of ad text based on their original copy. The launch of the new tools follows the company’s Meta Connect event last week where the social media giant debuted its Quest 3 mixed-reality headset and a host of other generative AI products, including stickers and editing tools, as well as AI-powered smart glasses. In the case of AI tools for the ad industry, the new products may not be as wild as the celebrity AIs that let you chat with virtual versions of people like MrBeast or Paris Hilton, but they showcase how Meta believes generative AI can assist the brands and businesses that are responsible for delivering the majority of Meta’s revenue. The first among the trio of new features allows an advertiser to customize their creative assets by generating multiple different backgrounds to change the look of their product images. This is similar to the technology that Meta used to create the consumer-facing tool Backdrop, which allows users to change the scene or the background of their image by using prompts. However, in the ad toolkit, the backgrounds are generated for the advertiser based on their original product images and will tend to be “simple backgrounds with colors and patterns,” Meta explains. The feature is available to those advertisers using the company’s Advantage+ catalog to create their sales ads. Another feature, image expansion, allows advertisers to adjust their assets to fit different aspect ratios required across various products, like Feed or Reels, for example. Also available to Advantage+ creative in Meta’s Mads Manager, the AI feature would allow advertisers to spend less time repurposing their creative assets, including images and video, for different surfaces, Meta claims. Meta says it’s already tested these AI features with a small but diverse set of advertisers earlier this year, and their early results indicate that generative AI will save them five or more hours per week, or a total of one month per year. However, the company admits that there’s still work ahead to better customize the generative AI output to match each advertiser’s style. ",
